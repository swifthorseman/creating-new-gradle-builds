= Creating New Gradle Builds

When encountering a project that uses Gradle for the first time, many developers don't know what Gradle can do for them. The purpose of this guide is to show some of the basic tasks that work in any Gradle build, regardless of type of project. In this guide, you'll create a trivial Gradle project, invoke some of the basic Gradle commands, and get a sense of how Gradle manages the project.

== What you'll need

* About [.time-to-complete-text]#NN#
* A text editor or IDE
* A Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.7 or better (only necessary to run Gradle)
* A https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution], version {gradle-version} or better

== Create a project

You can start a new project simply by creating a `build.gradle` file and adding build logic to it. To keep this example as simple as possible, create a new directory and add an empty file called `build.gradle` to it.

NOTE: Shell commands will shown for Unix-based systems. Windows has analogous commands for each.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ mkdir basic-demo
$ cd basic-demo
$ touch build.gradle // <1>
----
<1> Create an empty file called `build.gradle`

== Run the `tasks` command

Gradle is a general-purpose build tool for projects. Gradle itself is built on an object-oriented API, which is made up of many classes and methods, along with a simple syntax for configuring them. The build file itself configures an instance of the `org.gradle.api.Project` class, which has many built-in properties and methods. From the `Project`, you have access to all of Gradle's features.

By default, the name of the build file is called `build.gradle`. A `Project` includes a collection of _tasks_, each of which performs some basic operation.

To see what tasks are available even in this otherwise empty project, run the `tasks` command at the command prompt.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ gradle tasks

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-tasks.txt[]
----

As the output shows, Gradle tasks are organized into categories, like `Build Setup` or `Help`, and each has a name and an optional description. You can define your own (known as _ad hoc_) tasks, configure tasks provided by the Gradle library, or use tasks that are added by plugins.

== Generate a Gradle wrapper

As the output from the `tasks` command shows, the `wrapper` task generates a Gradle wrapper file. The wrapper is a small script and supporting jar and properties file that allows a user to execute Gradle tasks even if they don't already have Gradle installed. Generating a wrapper also ensures that the user will use the same version of Gradle as the person who created the project.

TIP: While Gradle versions are very good about supporting backward compatibility, using a wrapper ensures that the user is working with a version of Gradle that the project creator supports, and is therefore considered a good practice.

Details about the `wrapper` task can be seen through the `help` task.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ gradle help --task wrapper

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-help-wrapper.txt[]
----

By default, the `wrapper` task will generate a wrapper that uses the binary distribution of the same version as the Gradle command. Generate that wrapper now.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ gradle wrapper
:wrapper

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

This generates a Unix script called `gradlew` and a Windows command called `gradlew.bat`, along with a jar file and a properties file. The resulting directory structure looks like:

----
.
├── build.gradle
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew          // <1>
└── gradlew.bat      // <2>
----
<1> Wrapper script for Unix-based systems
<2> Wrapper script for Windows

All subsequent commands in this guide will use the wrapper.

== Run the `properties` task

If the `tasks` task tells you what tasks are available, the `properties` command does the same for the project's attributes. Try that command as well.

----
$ ./gradlew properties
----

NOTE: On Windows, you don't need the leading `./` in front of the `gradlew` command.

The output is extensive. Here are just a few of the available properties:

----
:properties

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project
------------------------------------------------------------

buildDir: /Users/.../basic-demo/build
buildFile: /Users/.../basic-demo/build.gradle
description: null
group:
name: basic-demo
projectDir: /Users/.../basic-demo
version: unspecified

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

The `name` of the project matches the name of the folder by default. You can also specify `group` and `version` properties, but at the moment they are taking their default values, as is `description`.

The `buildFile` property is fully-qualified path name to `build.gradle`, which resides in the `buildDir` -- by default, the `build` subdirectory of the `projectDir`, the directory containing the `build.gradle` file.

You can change many of the properties. Add the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/gradle-properties.gradle[]
----

Now run the `properties` task again and see the updated values of the `description` and `version` fields.

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew properties
:properties
...
include::{samplesoutputdir}/description.txt[]
...
include::{samplesoutputdir}/version.txt[]
....
----

== Configure a Gradle core task

Gradle comes with a library of tasks that you can configure in your own projects. For example, there is a core type called `Copy`, which copies files from one location to another. The `Copy` task is very powerful (see the documentation for details), but here, once again, keep it simple. Perform the following steps:

. Create a directory called `src`.
. Add a file called `myfile.txt` in the `src` directory. The contents are arbitrary (it can even be empty), but for convenience add the single line `Hello, World!` to it.
. In your `build.gradle` file, define a task called `copy` of type `Copy` (note the capital letter) that copies the `src` directory to a new directory called `dest`. (You don't have to create the `dest` directory -- the task will do it for you.) The syntax is:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/copy.gradle[]
----

Now you can run the `tasks` command with the `--all` flag to see the new task:

[listing.terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks --all

:tasks
...
include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-copy-tasks.txt[]
----

Execute the `copy` task:

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew copy

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-copy.txt[]
----

Verify that it worked as expected by checking that there is now a file called `myfile.txt` in the `dest` directory, and that its contents match the contents of the same one in the `src` directory.

== Configure a core task and use a plugin

Gradle includes a range of plugins, and many, many more are available at http://plugins.gradle.org[the Gradle plugin portal]. One of the plugins included with the distribution is the `base` plugin. Combined with a core type called `Zip`, you can create a zip archive of your project with a configured name and location.

Add the `base` plugin to your `build.gradle` file using the `plugins` syntax. Be sure to add the `plugins` block at the top of the file.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/zip.gradle[tags=plugins]

... rest of the build file ...
----

Now add a task that creates a zip archive from the `src` directory.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{samplescodedir}/zip.gradle[tags=zip]
----

The `base` plugin works with the settings to create an archive file called `basic-demo-1.0.zip` in the `build/distributions` folder.

In this case, simply run the new `zip` task and see that the generated zip file is where you expect.

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew zip

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-zip.txt[]
----

Run the `tasks` command again to see the tasks added by the `basic` plugin.

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks --all
tasks:

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-zip-tasks-1.txt[]

...

include::{samplesoutputdir}/gradle-zip-tasks-2.txt[]
----

The `assemble` and `build` tasks aren't useful in this project, because they are associated with compilation and generation of a release artifact. Many of the language plugins, like the `java` plugin, are created on top the `base` plugin.

The `clean` task, however, is an easy way to remove the `build` directory.

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew clean
clean:

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

The `build` directory should now be gone.

== Add a "Hello, World!" task

Since every technology needs a "Hello, World!" example, add an ad hoc task to your Gradle build. The syntax is:

[source,groovy]
----
task hello {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello, World!'
    }
}
----

When executed, this task will print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

[listing]
----
$ ./gradlew hello
:hello
Hello, World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

The contents of the `hello` task use commands from the Gradle DSL, like `task` and `doLast`. Writing your own tasks is an interesting topic, but beyond the scope of this guide. See {guides}writing-gradle-tasks[Writing Custom Gradle Tasks] for details.
